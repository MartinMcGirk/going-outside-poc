# weatherparsertest

FIXME: description

## Installation

The only thing that needs to be done at the moment is to create a new file in the resources folder called "config.edn" that contains the following text only:

{:darkskyApiKey "YOUR_KEY_GOES_HERE"}

Where YOUR_KEY_GOES_HERE is obviously replaced by your own darksky weather API key.

## Usage

FIXME: explanation

    $ java -jar weatherparsertest-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]

## Options

FIXME: listing of options this app accepts.
